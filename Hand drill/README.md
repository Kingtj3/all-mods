Graphene Armor [Beta]
Date: 11.10.2019
Version 0.9.9 - Graphene Oxygen and Graphene Hydrogen Bottles, Cargo, Balancing. Cleanup. 
Author: Bean (Brenku)


[b][NEW][/b] Graphene Oxygen and Graphene Hydrogen Bottles
* High-Visibility G-Menu icons. Never confuse Oxygen and Hydrogen tanks again!
[i]Note: These will [b]not[/b] interfere or replace the default oxygen/hydrogen bottles! THEY CO-EXIST![/i]
* (Both tanks) Mass = 3.33 (1/6th the weight of steel - per: http://luratia.com/graphene/tag/weight )
* (Both tanks) Volume = 80. Was 120 (Vanilla). It can be compressed more, due to the strength of the container holding it.
* Oxygen Capacity = 150. Was 100 (Vanilla). 50% increase to available oxygen in tank.
* Hydrogen Capacity = 1500. Was 1000 (Vanilla). 50% increase to available hydrogen in tank.

[b][Added][/b] Added information for pricing, for shop items. 

[b] [Changed] [/b] Graphene plates are now half the weight, but require twice as many plates for existing blueprints. This is to adjust to some properties which propogate through other Graphene mods/addons including this one. 

[b] [Changed] [/b] Graphene Cargo Container has been made to the same size and dimensions as vanilla cargo container. The benefits of graphene come from a lighter object (more on your mining ships!)

[b] [Removed] Wall-Mounted Batteries[/b]. Moved to addon mod. Not everyone wants it!

[b] [Removed] Graphene Solar Panels[/b]. Moved to addon mod. Not everyone wants it!
Get it here: [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1886502012] Graphene Lg. Solar Panel [Addon] [/url]

[Fixed all missing blueprints] Inn the production menus. All Graphene blocks should now be available for production. Look for their telltale icons to quickly find them.

[Fixed Icon] Graphene PowerCell component was indistinguishable from vanilla cells. I was making the wrong ones on occasion and wasting resources! Sorry! All graphene components have a distinguishable logo. 

[Fixed Icon] Graphene Stairs were indistinguishable from vanilla. Sorry! All graphene parts now have a distinguishable logo. 

[Fixed Icon] Graphene Ramp was indistinguishable from vanilla. Sorry! All graphene parts now have a distinguishable logo. 

[Other]
* Code Cleanup - All XML is cleaner
* Mod should be much smaller with the removal of some textures and models. :)
	- Previous File Size: 111.046 MB

[Up Next:]
* Missing 2x1x1 blocks/textures. This will take me a bit of time. But I want it for 1.0!
* Figure out why Graphene Catwalk is shown twice in the G-menu. 
* Other texture changes
* Progression System
* Balancing ([url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/332768931] Suggestions welcome here. [/url]
* What about graphene in use for a jump drive? Plausible increase in capacitive charging, and lighter weight, which remains true to graphene properties. 15% increase in charging, and shave the weight from steel plates to graphene plates?

Version 0.9.8 - Updated Carbon Ore
Author: Bean (Brenku)

Fixed: Carbon Ore was not spawning properly in games. It now has a slightly new/darker texture, and is about as common as Nickel.
This reflects the changes KeenSWH made, having ores be more sparse in the universe. Carbon is very common, and makes it quite useful as a resource.

What's in the pipeline?
Considering how to re-texture existing blocks, and add missing slopes. Don't get too excited yet. It's for the future!

Version 0.9.7.2 - Hotfix for SE Update 1.184.004 (default)
Date: 17.09.2017

Update: Fixes for code I did in a rush. Sorry guys!

Temporarily disabling Graphene Ore Detectors in the code. Code exists, but Graphene Ore Detector blocks can't be used.

I will work on a fix for this when time permits.

Version 0.9.7 - Fixes and New Item
Date: 19.07.2017

NEW! Compact Large Ship Antenna (1x1x1). Courtesy of Kookas 
	- Koookas: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340298930
	- I used his small ship compact antenna and made it fit Large Blocks. 
		- Overpowered maybe, but I wanted a less obtrusive option
		- Can consider that it uses graphene nanoantennas
		- http://www.thegraphenecouncil.org/blogpost/1501180/261234/Graphene-is-leading-to-ultrafast-wireless-communication
			
Added: Graphene Oxygen and Graphene Hydrogen Bottles are now compatibile with Independent Survival Mod.
Fixed: Catwalk plate build model purple.

What's in the pipeline?
New Reactor system. Possibly Hydrogen or Deuterium.

Version 0.9.6 - Tweaks and New Items
Date: 09.07.2017

NEW! - Graphene Oxygen and Hydrogen Bottles
	I wanted an easier visual for the Hydrogen and Oxygen bottles. I felt they were too similar.
		* While I was in there.. I thinned and strengthened the bottles. Now they have a slightly smaller size in your backpack, yet contain a 20% increase to Oxygen/Hydrogen in the bottles. Graphene allowed us to compress more gas into the bottles without rupturing them!
		* [i]Note: These will [b]not[/b] interfere or replace the default oxygen/hydrogen bottles.[/i]
		
Added: Catwalk plate to cube scroll/select.
Added: Power options to the cube scroll/select. Equip to G-Menu the Graphene Lg. SuperCapacitor to use. 
Added: Ore Detector variants to the cube scroll/select.
Lowered the Aerogel requirements considerably.

What's in the pipeline?
New Reactor system. Possibly Hydrogen or Deuterium.

Version 0.9.5 - Icon and Compatibility Fix - New Blocks 
Date: 28.06.2017

NEW! Replaced ALL Graphene icons with custom icons. They are cleaner, easier to read, and to find.
NEW! Compatibility with 'Independent Survival Mod'. Can craft graphene components in your suit assembler.  
NEW! Graphene Wall Mounted Battery Lg and Sm models. However, they are EQUAL in output, as they are identical sizes. 
NEW! Graphene Solar Panels - 1x1 Panel for Small Projects  
Fixed: Missing textures on Graphene Plate and Small Graphene Cube Build Models  
Fixed: Missing blueprints.
Fixed: Changed some Blueprint Names - Easier to Distinguish Small ship vs. Large Ship blocks. Small ships have [SM] before name.
Fixed: Weapons / Categories. Still a few need to adjust. Will do shortly in an incremental.
Changed: Graphene SuperCapacitors are effectively DOUBLE vanilla batteries, and now up to 10x speeds possible for charging.
Changed: Graphene SuperCapacitors are now initially set to 40% charge instead of 65%

Changelog:
Current version v0.8 [Beta] - Developer Update: 04/06/2016 - 06/26/2016

* NEW - Added the most requested feature... CARBON! and GRAPHITE Powder!
	- 1 unit of Carbon will refine to 0.10% Graphite Powder
	- Graphite Powder can be used to produce Graphene Plates, Graphene Aerogel, and Carbon Nanotubes!
	- Graphene Aerogel - Are used in the construction of various Graphene blocks. 
        ~ For example: Used to fill the insides of graphene cubes. Adds plausibility to the design, and more fun!
		~ See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerographene
		~ Very light, but takes up storage volume. 
	- Carbon Nanotubes are used in the construction of various Graphene blocks. 
	- Graphene Plates can be used to create existing and the new items!

See Change Notes here for previous versions.

------------------------------------------------

Developer Update: 10/25/2015 - Current version v0.5 [Beta] 
Just kidding! Here is color for you. How and why? You can think my friend Ninlilizi for her awesome handiwork with my texture. THANK YOU NINLILIZI!

* NEW - Colorable blocks[1] 

Notes:
[1] - DX11 Only. DX9 is graphene colored only. Colorable coming soon!)


Developer Update: 10/25/2015 - Current version v0.4 [Beta] 
Good news everyone! DX11 is here. No more blah blocks in your game. 
However, this is a temporary patch version, as there is currently NO COLORATION yet.

* NEW - Added DX11 Textures
* Changed: Various

Known issues:
* There is a small issue with construction models of slope/corner. 
* Normals on blast door
* ? Report back!



Developer Update: 03/23/2015 - Current version v0.3.4 [Beta] 
Good news, they released the DS files in a zip into the SE folders. Makes it a lot easier for me to update my mod. The last few weeks have been really challenging for me IRL. I know a lot of modders say that, and it's true.. we are hobbyists who really like something and contribute, but it's only a small portion of our lives. In any case, I have NOT given up on this mod. 

Here is what I would like to do: 
* Add the new blocks 
* Add thrusters and ramps 
* Investigate options for a new texture 
* Look into texture at a distance 

Those are the 4 things that seem to be the most important to people. Feel free to weigh in, but be constructive and realistic with your expectations please. I will post this above in the mod details. 

Update: 
12/27/2014 - Version 0.3.4 

* NEW - Added Graphene Plate 
* Changed: Weight of small cubes 

Update: 
11/13/2014 - Version 0.3.3 

* NEW - Added Graphene 'Slim' Cube 
This cube can be used similar to a blast door cube. It's collision model is slightly smaller (5%) than the cube model. This allows other normal sized cubes to slide between them. 

Suggested uses: Graphene Blast Door. Why not use the included Graphene blast door models? Why this extra cube? Simple! The blast door models (made by keen, and coated with graphene) are different than the other cube models. 1 rocket shot at a blast door cube will destroy it. It is however, resistant to grinding. But what is a blast door if it can't withstand a rocket attack? Thus the Graphene Slim Cube was born. 

Notes: 
* Texture is not quite lined up exactly, but it's very close. Probably won't notice. 
* Right now, only the slim large cube is available. More will come later, most likely this weekend. 
* Video demo to come shortly. 
* Possible re-texturing of all models in this mod to better line up and look more HD. 

Update: 
11/11/2014 - Version 0.3.2 

Changes: 
* Steel plates required for large blocks have been vastly reduced. This helps keep the armor light. Assume 1 steel plate per 'side' of the construction object. This may change, but for now it's how it is. 
* Stone is now used to create Graphene plates instead of steel. Assume that you can 'extract' trace amounts of graphite or carbon from this. Not only does this provide a use for you to get rid of all that rock, but it's a fun way to utilize it. 

Please remember that this mod is a BETA. You won't have the disappearing blocks problem again, I promise that. Other things like today's update will change as I get feedback from the community, and play with it more. 

Update: 
11/10/2014 - Version 0.3.1 [Hotfix] 
Fixed: Crash to desktop when trying to create a Graphene plate. 
Sorry about that!! 

Previous Major Update: 
11/09/2014 - Version 0.3 - Now in Beta! 

Changes: 
* NEW: New texture. Better seamlessness, smaller, sleeker, shinier. 
* NEW: Added Colorable Blocks [Check out the new photos above] 
* NEW: Added Blast Armor textures 
* Updated: All Armor cube blocks now textured and available: Small/Large of Cube, Slope, Triangle, Inverted Triangle. 
* Optimized: Smaller mod size, increased texture quality. Magic! 
* Balance: Adjusted required components for Graphene plates to be less resource demanding. 
* Balance: Adjusted build requirements 
* Balance: Adjusted strength of plates 
* Fixed: Versioning information. 
* Fixed: Missing textures on small blocks 
* Fixed: Seamless Texture 

Information about the block so far: 
Graphene Armor Block = 150kg 
Original Heavy Armor Block = 3,000kg 
Original Light Armor block = 500kg 

You need to make Graphene Plates first which take materials. 
0.5 Cobalt Ingot 
150 Stone 
Platinum Ingot flakes. 

This new beta mod is still very strong and very light. It looks better, and is less intensive to build [Survival]. You can also color them which is a huge fun thing to add. 

How you can help: 
* I don't play a lot of survival lately, so I could use constructive feedback about it. 
* Please, as a courtesy to each other, do not bicker in the comments. 

[Suggested uses]: 
Anti-griefer repellent. The materials take time to acquire... 

[Pro tips]: 
* Building a bunker door with these is a great way to defend your secret asteroid base. 
* Colorable blocks looking too washed out? Try adjust the Hue, Saturation, and Value. 

[Credits]: 
Each of the following modders have been hugely helpful and supportive in helping me with learning to mod. Their work stands on their own. Check them all out here: 

Lionel - Recently boggled our minds with the NASA Module 
DeadWeight4U - Modeling Master of the DeadTech brand 
[EDIM] Ekirei - Creator of the FrozenStar Technologies brand of blocks 

[Troubleshooting] 
If you have updated to this mod, and you can't place blocks or other weird things. First try deleting the 332768931.sbm file (on dedicated servers) or your local games mod folder. This forces it to redownload, and fixes most issues.
